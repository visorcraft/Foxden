**Finally, a cozy den for all your tabs!**

Foxden is a workspace manager for Firefox that lets you organize your tabs into separate workspaces. Think of it like having multiple desks, each with its own set of papers — switch between them instantly without losing your place!

## Why Foxden?

Ever find yourself drowning in 50+ tabs? We've been there. Foxden gives your tabs a proper home:

- **Create workspaces** — Group tabs by project, topic, or mood (yes, there's a "cat videos" workspace calling your name)
- **Switch instantly** — Jump between workspaces with a click. Inactive tabs hide away, keeping your tab bar zen
- **Find anything** — Quick search across ALL your tabs and workspaces. No more "where did I put that?"
- **Stay organized** — Color-code workspaces, pin your favorites, even create folders!
- **Keyboard ninja?** — Full keyboard shortcuts for the power users among us
